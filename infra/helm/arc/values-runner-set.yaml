# Shared configuration for ARC runner scale sets
# Blue and green scale sets inherit from this base configuration
# Helm chart: oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set
#
# CURRENT STATE: Running without DinD to get stable CI working
# TODO: Add DinD support later once basic runners are stable
#
# ROOT CAUSE FOUND: When using containerMode.type=dind with custom containers,
# ARC's merge behavior doesn't work properly, causing runners to exit immediately.
# SOLUTION: Don't use custom containers - let ARC handle everything.
