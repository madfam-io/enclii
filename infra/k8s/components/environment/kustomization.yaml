# Environment Configuration Component
#
# This component provides consolidated environment variable management.
#
# Files:
#   - common.env: Shared across all environments
#   - production.env: Production-specific overrides
#   - staging.env: Staging-specific overrides
#
# Usage in overlay kustomization.yaml:
#
#   # Production example:
#   configMapGenerator:
#     - name: env-config
#       envs:
#         - ../../components/environment/common.env
#         - ../../components/environment/production.env
#       behavior: merge
#
#   # Staging example:
#   configMapGenerator:
#     - name: env-config
#       envs:
#         - ../../components/environment/common.env
#         - ../../components/environment/staging.env
#       behavior: merge
#
# Then reference in deployments:
#
#   spec:
#     template:
#       spec:
#         containers:
#           - name: my-service
#             envFrom:
#               - configMapRef:
#                   name: env-config
#
# Note: Secrets should still be referenced via secretKeyRef in patches.
# This component only manages non-sensitive configuration.
