# Billing & Pricing FAQ

Questions about Enclii costs, pricing structure, and billing.

## Pricing Model

### How much does Enclii cost?

Enclii runs on fixed-cost infrastructure rather than usage-based billing. Current infrastructure costs:

| Component | Cost/Month |
|-----------|------------|
| Hetzner AX41-NVME (Dedicated Server) | ~$50 |
| Cloudflare R2 (Object Storage) | ~$5 |
| Cloudflare Tunnel | $0 |
| Total Infrastructure | **~$55/month** |

This compares to:
- Railway: ~$2,000/month for similar workloads
- Auth0: ~$220/month for authentication
- **Traditional SaaS Stack**: ~$2,220/month

### What's included in the base cost?

- **Compute**: Shared access to dedicated server resources
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for databases and files
- **Networking**: Unlimited bandwidth (fair use policy)
- **SSL Certificates**: Automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
- **Custom Domains**: Unlimited custom domains
- **Build Pipeline**: Unlimited builds
- **Logs & Metrics**: Built-in observability

### Are there any hidden fees?

No hidden fees. The only additional costs might be:
- **Egress from R2**: First 10GB/month free, then $0.015/GB
- **Premium support**: Available for enterprise customers
- **Additional regions**: Custom pricing

### Is there a free tier?

Enclii is designed for organizations rather than individual hobbyists. We don't offer a free tier, but:
- No minimum commitment
- Pay only for infrastructure used
- Scale up or down as needed

Contact us for startup pricing if you're early-stage.

## Cost Comparison

### How does Enclii compare to Railway?

**Railway pricing example** (typical startup):
- 2 services × $20/month = $40
- Database: $20/month
- Bandwidth: $50/month (variable)
- Build minutes: $30/month
- **Total: ~$140-200/month** (small scale)
- At scale: $2,000+/month

**Enclii**: ~$55/month fixed, regardless of number of services.

### How does Enclii compare to Vercel?

Vercel is optimized for frontend/edge. Enclii is for full-stack:

| Scenario | Vercel | Enclii |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Static site | $0-20 | $55 (shared) |
| Full-stack app | $50-200 | $55 |
| Multiple services | $200+ | $55 |
| Database included | No | Yes |

Enclii makes sense when you need backend services, databases, or have multiple apps.

### What about the 5-year savings?

Based on our cost analysis:
- Traditional SaaS: $2,220/month × 60 months = $133,200
- Enclii: $55/month × 60 months = $3,300
- **5-Year Savings: ~$129,900**

This assumes similar scale and features.

## Billing Details

### How am I billed?

Currently, Enclii infrastructure is managed directly:
- Pay for your own Hetzner server
- Or share resources on MADFAM infrastructure

No invoicing or credit card processing yet (coming soon).

### Can I bring my own infrastructure?

Yes! Enclii can run on:
- Your own Hetzner server
- Any Kubernetes cluster
- Cloud providers (AWS EKS, GCP GKE, etc.)

You control the infrastructure, we provide the platform layer.

### What if I exceed resource limits?

Unlike usage-based platforms, there are no surprise bills. If you hit resource limits:
1. You'll see performance degradation
2. We'll notify you
3. You can upgrade your infrastructure
4. No automatic overage charges

### Are there per-user costs?

No per-seat pricing. Your entire team can use Enclii at no additional cost:
- Unlimited users
- Unlimited projects
- Unlimited services
- Unlimited deployments

## Resource Allocation

### How are resources shared?

On shared infrastructure, resources are allocated via Kubernetes:

| Resource | Guaranteed | Burstable |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| CPU | 100m (0.1 core) | Up to available |
| Memory | 128Mi | Up to limit |
| Storage | Per PVC | - |

You can request higher allocations for production workloads.

### What if I need dedicated resources?

Options for dedicated resources:
1. **Dedicated namespace**: Isolated from other tenants
2. **Dedicated node**: Your own server in our cluster
3. **Dedicated cluster**: Complete isolation

Contact us for dedicated pricing.

### Can I set spending limits?

Yes. Configure alerts and limits per project:

```yaml
# Service configuration
budget:
  monthlyLimit: 100  # Alert at $100/month
  hardLimit: 150     # Throttle at $150/month
```

Budgets apply to resource usage metrics, not actual billing.

## Enterprise

### Is there enterprise pricing?

Yes. Enterprise features include:
- Dedicated infrastructure
- SLA guarantees (99.95%+)
- Priority support
- Custom integrations
- Compliance certifications
- On-premises deployment option

Contact sales@enclii.dev for enterprise pricing.

### Do you offer volume discounts?

For organizations running multiple environments or large workloads:
- Custom infrastructure sizing
- Bulk pricing for multi-year commitments
- Partner discounts for agencies/consultancies

### Can I get an invoice?

Enterprise customers receive proper invoicing with:
- Net-30 payment terms
- PO/requisition support
- Custom billing cycles

## Refunds & Cancellation

### What's your refund policy?

Since infrastructure is managed directly:
- No contracts or commitments
- Cancel anytime
- Pay only for what you use
- No cancellation fees

### How do I cancel?

1. Export your data (see migration docs)
2. Delete your projects
3. Contact support to offboard
4. Stop paying for infrastructure

We provide a full offboarding guide to ensure smooth transitions.
